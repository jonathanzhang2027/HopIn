## Inspiration

HopIn was born from the need to address the transportation challenges faced by college students. Recognizing the rising costs and limited resources, we aimed to create a platform that connects students traveling to similar destinations. Our goal was to foster a sense of community while offering a cost-effective and safe ridesharing experience.

## What it Does

HopIn is a ridesharing app specifically designed for college students. It provides the following features:

*   **Ride Posting:** Allows drivers to post rides with essential details such as source, destination, price, and available seats.
*   **Ride Searching:** Enables riders to search for and request rides that align with their schedule and budget.
*   **Request & Confirmation System:** Provides a seamless request and confirmation system for drivers and riders to manage ride participation effectively.
*   **User Authentication:** Incorporates secure user authentication to ensure a reliable and safe platform.

## How We Built It

The HopIn app was built using the following technologies:

*   **Frontend:** React Native, for building a cross-platform mobile application compatible with both iOS and Android.
*   **Backend:** Firebase, for real-time database management, user authentication, and secure storage solutions.
*   **Development Tooling:** Expo, facilitating simultaneous mobile and web development, enabling efficient testing and deployment processes.
*   **Firestore Structure:**
    *   `Users`: Stores user information, including posted rides and ride participation data.
    *   `Rides`: Stores comprehensive ride details, including driver and rider information, pricing, and availability.
