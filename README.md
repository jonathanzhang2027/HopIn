# HopIn

Inspiration
The idea for HopIn was inspired by the challenges college students face when trying to find affordable and reliable transportation options. With rising costs and limited resources, we wanted to create a platform that connects students heading to similar destinations, fostering a sense of community while providing a cost-effective and safe ridesharing experience.

What it does
HopIn is a rideshare app designed for college students that:

Allows drivers to post rides with details like source, destination, price, and available seats. Enables riders to search for and request rides that fit their schedule and budget. Provides a request and confirmation system for drivers and riders to manage ride participation. Features user authentication to ensure a secure and reliable platform.

How we built it
We developed HopIn using:

Frontend: React Native for building a cross-platform mobile application. 
Backend: Firebase for real-time database management, user authentication, and secure storage. 
Expo: For simultaneous mobile and web development, enabling efficient testing and deployment. 
Firestore Structure: Users: Store user information, including postings and ride participation. 
Rides: Store ride details, including driver and rider information, pricing, and availability.
